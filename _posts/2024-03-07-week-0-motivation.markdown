Hello world! This is Diego. I am a software engineer from Spain.

I created this blog to _force_ me to learn in a structured way to improve my craft and deepen my understanding.

I have worked in different software-related jobs over the last 10 years. I have created iOS and
android apps, very different kinds of websites, APIs, etcetera. I have worked with many programming
languages, frameworks and technologies.

But I feel that I lack knowledge of the fundamentals of computing. I was very inspired by [this post][lurn] by Uncle Bob. It resonated with me because, as software engineers, we are often blinded by the latest, shiny tool, and we disregard the past. jQuery is out, just use React! React is out, just use Svelte! Node is out, just use ~~deno~~ bun! But, do we really understand the underlying challenge that these tools are trying to solve, and the tradeoffs that their authors had to make? The problems that we face are roughly the same since the 1960s: retrieving and storing information, searching, handling concurrent processes at scale... and yet we reinvent the wheel constantly. Of course, we do it because it's fun, and you get to learn a lot about physics by building wheels.

Another motivation to start this journey comes from thinking about the value of my skills in the near future. A company can hire a cheaper software developer to write code, or just tell ChatGPT to do it. But still a human engineer is needed to deeply understand a problem and craft a solution to it, understanding the tradeoffs.

Last but not least, it turns out that communicating is _hard_. Writing my ideas coherently is also a way of improving my understanding.

So, I commit to write at least a post a week. The plan for the following months is to learn at least a little bit more of the following topics:

- Data structures and algorithms: sorting, search, graphs, etc.
- Concurrency
- System design and architecture
- Debugging and optimization: the low level stuff
- Coding style and best practices
- Tools and technologies: infrastructure, networking, linux...

The idea is not to learn everything, but learn some things deeply. For the moment, I bought [_Classical Computer Science Problems in Python_][book] and I will report back next week with what I learned from the first chapter.

Stay tuned!

PS: Right now the blog looks quite mediocre, it's my first time using Jekyll and didn't have time to look into customising it. It'll get better.
